    <p>It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.</p>
<p>“As wet as ever,” said Alice in a melancholy tone: “it doesn’t seem to dry me at all.”</p>
<p>It was all very well to say “Drink me,” but the wise little Alice was not going to do <em>that</em> in a hurry. “No, I’ll look first,” she said, “and see whether it’s marked ‘<em>poison</em>’ or not”; for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they <em>would</em> not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger <em>very</em> deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked “poison,” it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.</p>
